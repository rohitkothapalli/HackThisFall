### Project Description:- ###
College Pick is all about helping High School Exams qualified students to find best private college across the country. This hands-on scrapped data from thousands of websites definitely helps student in choosing right course and college. We have displayed best colleges along with the detailed information.

Youth are the nation's future. After 12th grade, students are among the most crucial times of a selecting a good college for their further studies. To help students along their journey to a successful platform with the right intake of information is what College Pick is developed to achieve.

We provide students with all required resources on a single platform, taking into account their time restrictions. Also due to this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, students are not able to go to colleges or universities offline, therefore this is a little initiative from our team to help students virtually.
